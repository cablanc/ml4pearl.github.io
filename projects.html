	The research group is currently focused on Neighborhood Effects. These projects investigate the implications of neighborhood characteristics for political behavior, taking particular care to distinguish between objective conditions of the neighborhood (e.g. percent in poverty) and subjective conditions of the neighborhood (e.g., presence of graffiti).
