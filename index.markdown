title: ML4PEARL
subtitle: Machine Learning 4 Political Economy and Race Lab
---
The Research Group brings together faculty and undergraduate students to develop critical and creative approaches to advance questions of race and political economy. By removing traditional disciplinary boundaries, this group aims to rethink and repurpose machine learning models to explore socio-economic inequalities and produce compelling research with broad societal impact.

The research group is currently focused on Neighborhood Effects. These projects investigate the implications of neighborhood characteristics for political behavior, taking particular care to distinguish between objective conditions of the neighborhood (e.g. percent in poverty) and subjective conditions of the neighborhood (e.g., presence of graffiti).

We are broadly interested in leveraging the underlying structure of data to improve and interpret learning outcomes in neural network models. Interpretable models provide an opportunity to affirm or deny existing hypotheses; garner additional insights and inspire new hypotheses. We are motivated by current scholarship on the interplay between race and technology and criticisms of the ill-advised adaptation of technological tools to social problems; and we are inspired by the
scholars who are reimagining technological tools for remediation of the systemic inequalities.
